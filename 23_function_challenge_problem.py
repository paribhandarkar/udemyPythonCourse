# CHALLENGING PROBLEMS

'''
SPY GAME: Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains 007 in order
 spy_game([1,2,4,0,0,7,5]) --> True
 spy_game([1,0,2,4,0,5,7]) --> True
 spy_game([1,7,2,0,4,5,0]) --> False

            code.remove(num)

print(spy_game([1,2,4,0,0,7,5]))
print(spy_game([1,0,2,4,0,5,7]))
print(spy_game([1,7,2,0,4,5,0]))

'''
COUNT PRIMES: Write a function that returns the number of prime numbers that exist up to and including a given number
count_primes(100) --> 25

By convention, 0 and 1 are not prime.

Just for fun, not a real problem :)

PRINT BIG: Write a function that takes in a single letter, and returns a 5x5 representation of that letter
print_big('a')

out:   *  
      * *
     *****
     *   *
     *   *
HINT: Consider making a dictionary of possible patterns, and mapping the alphabet to specific 5-line combinations of patterns.
For purposes of this exercise, it's ok if your dictionary stops at "E".
