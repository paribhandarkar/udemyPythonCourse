    "generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "The basic idea is that generators allow us to generate a sequence of values over time instead of having to create an entire sequence and hold it in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "when a generator function is compiled, they become an object that supports some sort of iteration protocol.\n",
    "That means when they're actually called in your code, they don't return a value and then exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution state around the last point of value generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage here is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values up front and hold it in memory, the generator computes one value and waits until the next value is called for.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can imagine if you wanted to get all the numbers between one and 1 million, you have two options here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either start generating values one, two, three, four, and then feed them that way, for example, in a for loop.\n",
    "Or you would create a giant list of numbers one through a million, and then slowly pick off those numbers from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "range itself is a generator and it's just remembering the last number it sent out and then the step size to generate the new number. That way it doesn't have to store this huge list in memory and it makes it a lot more efficient."
